# Password_generoator
In this project I created a password genorator with customizable settings so you can create a password with all the qualifications. 
it took me a really long time but I was able to get it down and eventually got it working. 
I ended up using the ascii chart and created functions to make arrays for me,
using the ascii charts. after reaserching to find out how to get math to do that It ended up working, 
I might have made it a bit more complicated onmyself than it really needed to be but it still ended upo working and I belive its pretty efficient.
(sorry i couldnt firgure out how to add pictures i will meet up with a tutor)
